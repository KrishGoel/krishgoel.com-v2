                    <p>I am a technophile and a full-time "flex machine" from New Delhi. I am currently completing my high schooling from <a href="http://sanskritischool.edu.in" target="_blank">Sanskriti School</a> and will be joining <a href="javascript:void(0)" target="_blank">Some University</a> for pursuing every Indian dads&apos; dream for their son - <s>MBA</s>  Engineering (+ Elective) (voluntarily, I'll the CS cutoff) this fall.</p>
                    <p>While web-development and programming is my m&eacute;tier, I&rsquo;m currently in the search for my Ikigai.</p>
                    <p>I occasionally venture into introducing the beautiful intricacies of programming to the younger students during my summer breaks and looking at the bigger picture, I aspire to develop &quot;smarter energy sources&quot;.</p>
