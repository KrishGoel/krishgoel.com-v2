title: TERI - Rural Sensitisation
date: April 2019
datestamp: "04.2019"
description: A rural sensitisation programme to the village of Kathgodam,
  Uttarakhand wherein we worked with the locals. We visited the village school
  and worked with local farmers, understood their means of livelihood and the
  importance of technology. The simplistic yet elegant implementations of
  technology at the TERI facility was fascinating.
