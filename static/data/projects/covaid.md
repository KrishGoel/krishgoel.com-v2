Giving back to the society we take so much from has always been a part, if not the central theme, of my vision for the future. I try my best to work towards the betterment and upliftment of not just the underprivileged but every single person because of my strong faith in the idea of rising by lifting others.

With the second wave of the pandemic in the NCR came a spike in the number of distress calls. The very fact that people who weâ€™ve shared our lives with were being reduced to mere numbers shook us to our very bones. I coordinated with 4 of my peers and, in under 48 hours, we assembled a team of 40+ volunteers and deployed our service. The aim was to provide only personally verified leads to the ones who need it the most because the nation had lost innumerable lives to inaccurate information dispersal.

We began with the goal of saving just 1 and yet, within a week, we had reached upwards of 23,000 users.  After successfully overcoming the challenges to operations in our hometown of Delhi, we collaborated and deployed our service to the city of Kanpur. Our efforts were applauded by several celebrities and newspapers alike.
