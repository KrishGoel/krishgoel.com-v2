date: August 2020
datestamp: "08.2020"
description: We went classic input-box with the second edition of ProjectBeta's
  infamous cryptic hunt, while we didn't suffer any DDoS attacks, our servers
  went offline regularly. Even though the event wasn't the smoothest, we learnt
  a lot about handling a real life crisis.
