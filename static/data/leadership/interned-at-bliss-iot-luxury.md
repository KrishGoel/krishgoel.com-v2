description: I interned at my dad's IoT luxury watch startup - Bliss, we aimed
  at developing a luxurious watch with everything you'll find in a Rolex while
  combining it with smartness far greater than any of the current smartwatches.
  This is where I really felt the spark that pushed me into the technological
  domain.
