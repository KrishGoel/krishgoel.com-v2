## To-do for future upgrades
- [ ] Use [Notion NoCode API](https://nocodeapi.com/pricing) for /garden. Fetch once/day directly into the repo to not breach the 300 reqs/month limit.
- [ ] GitHub repo update
- [ ] Add the project filtering tag system as suggested by Ishaan
- [ ] Add CMS functionality to socials.json, maybe
- [ ] Switch from Last.FM to Spotify for Music fetching
