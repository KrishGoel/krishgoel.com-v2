    - [ ] Fix ```/recent/books```
- [ ] Fix the texts etc
- [ ] All cards change there position on the mobile views because of row-stacking, fix it using the snippet from krishgoel.com```-v3```
- [ ] GitHub repo update
- [ ] Before pushing to production, ensure that the meta URLs are changed to krishgoel.com and not krishgoel-v4.vercel.app
